## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r loading in the data}
# Read a gene expression TSV (GSE11111.tsv) into R as a data.frame with base R
expression_df <- read.delim("dataset_final/SRP033566/SRP033566.tsv", header = TRUE,
                            row.names = 1, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# Reading JSON Files
metadata_list <- fromJSON(file = "dataset_final/aggregated_metadata.json")
```

## Including Plots

```{r heatmap, echo=FALSE}
# Generate a heatmap SUPER WRONG RIGHT NOW
# pheatmap(expression_df, 
#          scale = "row",       # Scale genes to have mean=0 and variance=1
#          clustering_distance_rows = "euclidean", 
#          clustering_distance_cols = "euclidean", 
#          clustering_method = "complete", 
#          show_rownames = FALSE) # Hide row names for better visibility (you can change this as per your requirement)
```
